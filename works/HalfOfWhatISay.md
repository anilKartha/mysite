## Half Of What I Say
(Bloomsbury, 2016)

### About The Novel

_Half Of What I Say_ is a political romance set in contemporary India. As the title suggests, we humans are incomplete creatures. We see things in half, our best efforts are only half-understood, we misrecognize whom we love, and we live in worlds half-fulfilled. Vyas, one of the main protagonists of the novel, is such a man.

All Vyas wants is to go home to his wife Tanaz. But his job as chief censor for the Lokshakti--- the Indian State's corrupt anti-corruption bureau--- keeps them apart. Lonely and deeply conflicted over his sinister duties, Vyas writes Tanaz a confessional love-letter (hand-written and multi-page, naturally), which unfortunately ends up with Durga Dhasal, scholar, humanist and and all-around political nuisance. When the Lokshakti murders Dhasal, Vyas has to find the incriminating letter before it is too late.

The trail leads Vyas to other people with other necessities, including: Bilkis Ansari, patriotic cannon-fodder and true friend; Kannagi, a scientist torn between exit and loyalty; Anand Dixit, a businessman who collects ruins; Saya, a fading actress who believes she was once Shahzadi Jahanara; and Mir Alam Mir, an eunuch poet perhaps overly fond of Jewish jokes. Vyas in his quest for the letter is led to a subversive new myth that cannot exist in Vyas' world. It is true stories make a difference. But the absence of a story? What difference can the absence of a story make?

### Origins

I began writing the novel about six years ago.  At the time, Anna Hazare had just captured the country's imagination with his anti-corruption movement. I was totally fascinated by the propaganda, counter-propaganda, the passions it aroused. It was clear what the people _didn't_ want: corruption. But it wasn't clear what people _did_ want. They were united by a common negative, a unity supported by an extravagant suspension of disbelief. In other words, they were being led by a story. It made me very uneasy. Modern tyrannies are often mass movements gone terribly wrong. I started to think about what stories do, about how we misrecognize objects of our desire, and about how it would be if such a regime truly understood the power of (erasing) stories.

### About the title

The title comes from Gibran's _Sand & Foam_. There's a verse which goes: _Half of what I say is meaningless, but I have to say it nonetheless, so that the other half may reach you_. I cannot control how you'll read the story and you cannot control how I wrote it. If I could control your response, I would find another profession. If you could control mine, what I have to say would just be your echo. At the heart of storytelling lies this primitive freedom. It's a freedom that shapes all our arrangements; that is, it is a political freedom.

That is the heavy funda version. A simpler one is that my wonderful editor Himanjali Sankar and I were racking our brains what to call the masterpiece. This title bubbled up.
