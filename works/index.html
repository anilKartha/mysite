	{% blurb "In spite of all the twists and turns, in both the stories and in the odysseys of the protagonists, Half of What I Say, examines, above all, the power of words and the scope of stories." "&emsp;&emsp;&mdash;SUNEETHA BALAKRISHNAN, The Hindu" " "%}
	{% blurb "What a delightful, delightful novel! What Anil Menon has built here is a masterpiece of plot structure. The language and style, though beautiful in their own right, sit back whenever storytelling changes gears." "&emsp;&emsp;&mdash;SHALIM M. HUSSAIN, The Pioneer" " " %}
	{% blurb "You can't power-read this over 400-page novel. There are too many threads and ongoing linkages between the characters, though compartmentalised in discrete chapters or sections. Time seems suspended. While the plot is synchronic, there is a feel of unhitched time throughout â€” leaving the impression that some of the action is happening in parallel, most of which is cross-referenced. Menon is a wordsmith, with a talent for verbosity,but thankfully relieved with humour, sometimes brilliant. I can't remember laughing out loud while reading fction until now. The world is ready for this book. It is a paradigm changer." "&emsp;&emsp;&mdash;RICHARD COHEN, Biblio" " " %}
