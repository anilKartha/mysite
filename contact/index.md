I love letters. I love writing them and I love receiving them. My father (C. R. Ravindaran Menon) was an inveterate letter writer.{% marginfigure "marg1" "assets/img/aerogram2.jpg" " " %} He took trouble over his letters, often educating the receiver with pithy quotes or summaries of whatever he was reading. My mother (Subhadra Kunjamma) would fill the aerogram's back-flap with her painstakingly-learned English and find different ways to tell me the same thing: how much she loved me and missed me. I was often away at far-off places working for the Man and remember the anticipation with which I looked forward to their aerograms. It was really advanced tech: our hands and minds could touch across thousands of miles.{% marginnote "melm2" "It is a long time since I have had a letter from you. 'There is nothing to write about,' you say: well, then write and let me know just this, that 'there is nothing to write about,'&nbsp;&mdash; Pliny the Elder, Letter XI, [_Collected Letters_](https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.754){: target='blank'}." %} 

It doesn't matter that emails have now replaced letter-writing. There is no need to "revive the lost art of letter-writing". Those who care about words will find new ways of caring just as good as the old ways.

Perhaps you feel the same way.
