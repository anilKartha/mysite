I am a fiction writer. I am other things at other times, but mainly, I spend a lot of time thinking about imaginary people and their problems. It is an odd existence,{% marginnote "abt-minus1" "With all due apologies to $$\sqrt{-1}.$$" %} perhaps not the sort of thing grown-ups should be doing. People sometimes ask me if I had always wanted to be a writer. No, I had not. When I was about eight, I  wanted to be an accountant. My friends, when asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, would reply "engineer!" or "doctor!" Not me. I was going to be an accountant. I couldn’t wait to be an accountant.

For me, accountants represented the height of cool. That was because my late father, C. R. R. Menon,
{% marginfigure "abt-dad" "assets/img/father.gif" "Cherukulath Raman Ravindran Menon (1942-1995)." %}
was an accountant with Maharashtra's Office of the Accountant General. He worked for a General! At dinner time, he would talk about his day at the office. Father invariably made accountancy sound as exciting as exploring Mars or wind surfing or being a detective. His eyes would shine, his fingers would draw numbers in the air, and in the mornings, as he got ready for work, he would hum. I wanted a slice of the same happiness pizza.

Instead, I became a fiction writer. I went about in an unusually inane manner.{% marginnote "marquez-role" "'One night a friend lent me a book of short stories by Franz Kafka. I went back to the pension where I was staying and began to read _The Metamorphosis_. The first line almost knocked me off the bed.... When I read the line I thought to myself that I didn't know anyone was allowed to write things like that. If I had known, I would have started writing a long time ago. So I immediately started writing short stories.' -- Gabriel Garcia Marquez" %} I studied to be an electrical engineer and emerged as a computer scientist. I then worked as a software engineer for several startups, working on projects completely disconnected from my education. It was all great fun, but I knew what was coming and wasn't too surprised when I woke up one day and discovered I had turned into a writer. Once, I would've drummed up plausible reasons for the career shift, but these days I'm more skeptical about our supposed motives and reasons. I am a writer because I write because I am a writer.

I write all kinds of stories. When I'm cornered about genre preferences, I say most of my recent work probably falls under speculative fiction. This catch-all term includes genres like magic realism, surrealism, fabulism, fiction, science fiction and other genres where the imagination is deeply valued. To get a sense of why it's a different kind of fiction, think about how abstract art changed the way we see things. Or you could read Naiyer Masud's [_Sheesha Ghat_](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2013/20130930/2masud-f.shtml "Sheesha Ghat"){:target='blank'} or a {% marginnote "abt-sfdef" "Or you can [ask the cow](http://anilmenon.com/blog/?p=1822){:target='blank'}." %} Kannada folktale, [_A Story and a Song_](http://anilmenon.com/blog/a-perfect-tale/ "A Perfect Tale"){:target='blank'}.

Truth is, I don't take genre labels seriously. We must not to let a division of labor become a division of laborers. This goes for writers as well as readers. Personally, I see literature the way a goat sees the world; that is, a buffet. I hope you do too.

My most recent novel [_Half Of What I Say_](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/half-of-what-i-say-9789385436512/){:target='blank'} (Bloomsbury, 2015) was shortlisted for the 2016 Hindu Literary Award. My debut novel [_The Beast With Nine Billion Feet_](http://anilmenon.com/blog/wp-admin/beast.html){:target='blank'} (Zubaan, 2009) was shortlisted for the 2009 Crossword Prize and the Carl Baxter Society’s Parallax Award. Along with Vandana Singh, I co-edited [_Breaking The Bow_](http://zubaanbooks.com/shop/breaking-the-bow-speculative-fiction-inspired-by-the-ramayana/){:target='blank'} (Zubaan Books, 2012),{% marginnote "abt-sun" "Begin, ephebe, by perceiving the idea<br> Of this invention, this invented world,<br> The inconceivable idea of the sun.<br>&emsp;-- Wallace Stevens, _Notes Towards A Supreme Fiction_" %} an international anthology of short fiction inspired by the Ramayana. My stories have been translated into more than a dozen languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, Igbo, and Romanian. A collection of my speculative short fiction, *The Inconceivable Idea Of The Sun: Stories* (Hachette), will be published in Spring 2022.

I co-founded the [Dum Pukht Writers' Workshop](http://dumpukht.org/){:target='blank'}. This annual two-week residential workshop, currently in its fifth iteration, is held at the Adishakti Theatre Complex in the former French colony Puducherry (Pondicherry) in Tamil Nadu. Recently, I took over as fiction editor at _The Bombay Literary Magazine_. I hope we are agreed I am a thoroughly remarkable fellow.

When I talk about writing, my eyes shine, my fingers gesture in the air, and in the mornings, as I get ready for work, I hum. Remember I said I wanted a slice of the happiness pizza? Well friend, it tastes great! I hope you'll have as much pleasure reading my work as I had in creating it. Thank you for visiting.
